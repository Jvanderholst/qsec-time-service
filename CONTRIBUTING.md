Contributing to The Time Service
===================================
Contributions are welcome! To make sure we're all productive with this project, here are some basic rules that we've laid out: 

* Look into the issues tab of the project, to get started. We're constantly adding new issues, and makring them with relevant labels. Please prioritize the version currently in development, though. When you find an issue you like, *assign it to yourself*.
* Each contribution needs to be recieved through a Pull Request. Make sure you clone the repository. We suggest that you create a _feature branch_ and then merge it when it's done.
* The code you contribute _should_ be covered with unit tests. Those tests will get run automatically when the CI/CD pipeline is established.

This is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community â€” you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into The Time Service itself.

Bug reports
-----------
If you think you have found a bug in The Time Service, first make sure that you are testing against the latest version.

Contributing code and documentation changes
-------------------------------------------
If you have a bugfix or new feature that you would like to contribute to The Time Service, please find or open an issue about it first. Talk about what you would like to do. It may be that somebody is already working on it, or that there are particular issues that you should know about before implementing the change.

### Fork and clone the repository

You will need to fork the main The Time Service code or documentation repository and clone it to your local machine. See
[github help page](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) for help.

Further instructions for specific projects are given below.

### Submitting your changes

Once your changes and tests are ready to submit for review:

1. Test your changes

    Run the test suite to make sure that nothing is broken.

2. Rebase your changes

    Update your local repository with the most recent code from the main The Time Service repository, and rebase your branch on top of the latest master branch. We prefer your initial changes to be squashed into a single commit. Later, if we ask you to make changes, add them as separate commits.  This makes them easier to review.  As a final step before merging we will either ask you to squash all commits yourself or we'll do it for you.

4. Submit a pull request

    Push your local changes to your forked copy of the repository and [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests). In the pull request, choose a title which sums up the changes that you have made, and in the body provide more details about what your changes do. Also mention the number of the issue where discussion has taken place, eg "Closes #123".

Then sit back and wait. There will probably be discussion about the pull request and, if any changes are needed, we would love to work with you to get your pull request merged into The Time Service.
